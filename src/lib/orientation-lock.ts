 * The first clip sets the film's orientation. On a phone, how the device
 * is held wins: camera tracks are often landscape pixels even when the

 * (viewport only when size is unknown on a held device). Later clips
 * never overwrite a choice. Landscape still requires Plus — a gated
 * write leaves the project portrait and the take is kept.

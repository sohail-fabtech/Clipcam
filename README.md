# Kody Video

Mobile-first web clips camera: **hold anywhere on the preview to record**, arrange clips on a filmstrip timeline, then tap **Go** to export/share — all **on-device**.

Kody Video is inspired by the OK Video interaction model: camera-first capture, quick clip cleanup, and one big OK/share moment. It is an independent project with its own name, mark, and implementation; it is not affiliated with OK Video and does not use OK Video trademarks or assets. The koala mascot is credited to the KCD community / [kentcdodds.com/kody](https://kentcdodds.com/kody). App artwork in `public/art/` was generated from that Kody reference (camera, timeline, share, app icon).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed localhost URL in Chrome (desktop or Android). Camera/microphone require a **secure context** (`http://localhost` or HTTPS).

```bash
npm run build      # production build + service worker
npm run preview    # serve dist (PWA cache active)
npm test           # storage/export-planner unit tests (Vitest browser mode, real Chromium)
npm run test:e2e   # Playwright e2e suite (fake camera/mic; recording, editor, playback, export, plans)
npm run test:smoke # Playwright UX smoke (fake camera, records + exports)
```

**Live app:** [https://kody.video](https://kody.video) (Cloudflare Pages, builds from `main`)

For a phone on the same network, use your machine’s LAN URL over HTTPS, or tunnel (`npm run dev -- --host` plus a trusted tunnel). `getUserMedia` will fail on plain `http://<lan-ip>` in most browsers.

## What works

- Full-bleed live camera (rear preferred; flip, torch, and zoom when the device exposes them)
- Hold-to-record anywhere on the preview; drag up/down while holding to zoom
- Self-timer for hands-free takes (tap to stop)
- Recording feedback (REC pill + elapsed) with a page that does **not** re-render per frame — capture stays smooth
- Editor: filmstrip timeline (thumbnails, width ∝ duration), drag to reorder, duplicate, delete w/ undo, **in-timeline trim with drag handles**, **add clips and photos from your device/gallery**
- **Photos on the timeline**: a picked image becomes a still clip (3s by
  default) that plays in previews and exports like any other clip — silent,
  with a small camera badge on its tile. Instead of the trim strip, photos
  open a **Duration** strip: because a still has no media length to trim
  within, its on-screen time is a free choice that can grow as well as
  shrink — drag the handle across a 0–30s scale, tap a preset (1/2/3/5/10s),
  or nudge with ±0.5s steppers to land the exact length, with the precise
  readout always visible. Photos travel in backups and duplicate/reorder
  like clips
- **Per-clip audio levels**: every clip's audio is **peak-normalized** as a
  post-recording step (measured once, persisted on the clip, backfilled
  automatically when an older project loads), so takes recorded at
  different distances play back at consistent loudness — in the previews
  and in the export. Selecting a clip in the timeline shows a **Clip
  sound** slider: the clip's own volume, 0–100% (default 100%), applied
  with or without music
- **Background music** (Plus): build a playlist of audio tracks that play one
  after the other under the film (nothing loops — a hint suggests adding
  another track when the music ends before the film does). Each track
  carries its own **volume** (default 25% — normalized music sits under
  speech), set in the track's **detail view** (the audio counterpart of
  the clip trim view: trim the track to a kept window over its waveform,
  set its volume, and toggle its fade in/out — on by default; each track
  eases in where it starts and out where it ends, including the film's
  edges). The selected clip additionally gets a **Music** slider that
  ducks the playing track's volume during that clip (0–100%, default
  100%) — the clip's own sound and the music are independent dials, and
  the blend hard-clamps rather than coupling them. Volume changes glide
  across clip boundaries. All of it — volumes, normalization, fades,
  trims, track hand-offs — plays the same in the previews as in the
  exported file: the project preview runs the whole film's bed, and the
  editor's clip stage plays the music under the selected clip from its
  exact spot on the film's timeline (normalization boosts cap at the
  browser's volume ceiling in previews)
- **Landscape projects** (Plus): no setting — rotate the phone. While a
  project has no clips its interface follows how the device is held, and
  the **first take locks the orientation** (emptying the project of clips
  lets the next first take decide again). Landscape shifts the
  entire interface: the phone-shaped shell widens to the viewport, the
  record controls become a right-hand rail, the editor puts the player
  beside the timeline, and hints ask for a turn whenever the device
  mismatches the locked project. Exports are forced into a landscape
  project's orientation (mismatched clips center-crop), and the lock
  travels in backups. On the free plan, rotating an empty project previews
  the landscape interface but the take that would lock it opens the Plus
  upsell. Desktop is exempt (webcams and screen shares are landscape media
  without that being a choice): its projects stay unlocked and exports
  follow the clips, as always
- Project preview playback: tap edges to skip clips, tap middle to stop
- Up to **6** stable project slots (create / open / rename / delete, poster art from your clips)
- Big Go CTA: on-device export to **one video file**, then Share (system sheet) or Save
- Fallback: save clips as separate files
- Project **backup/import**: one `.kodyvideo` file per project (clips, trims,
  location data, background music + volumes) — a safety net, and the way to
  move a project between devices or browser origins (storage is per-origin);
  ⋯ → Save backup on a slot, import from the About page or by dropping a
  `.kodyvideo` file anywhere in the app
- **Send to another device** (Plus): a pairing code + QR introduces two
  browsers; the `.kodyvideo` travels over a WebRTC DataChannel (STUN only —
  same Wi‑Fi usually). Clips never land on our servers. Receiving is free
  at `/receive`. If the devices cannot connect, Save backup still works
- Installable PWA (manifest + Workbox service worker for the app shell)
- **No accounts, no uploads, no analytics**

Most QA is automated: `npm run test:e2e` runs the Playwright suite in
`tests/e2e/` (~40s). See [`manual-test-checklist.md`](./manual-test-checklist.md)
for what it covers and the remaining real-device-only checks.

## Architecture

Built with [Remix 3](https://github.com/remix-run/remix) (`remix@3.0.0`,
pinned) as a pure client-side app: `remix/component` components rendered
with `createRoot`, no server rendering. Routing stays a
tiny in-app `history` router (see `router.tsx`) rather than `remix/spa`, whose
frame navigation falls back to full document loads in browsers without the
Navigation API + `NavigateEvent.sourceElement` (Firefox, older iOS Safari) — a
reload mid-recording is not acceptable for a camera app.

### Chapters & file metadata

MP4 exports carry **chapter markers** at every clip boundary (Nero `chpl`,
injected post-mux by `lib/export/mp4-metadata.ts`), titled with each clip's
time of day (no calendar date), plus QuickTime text tags: the project title
(`©nam`), a short composition note (`©cmt` / `©des` — clip and photo counts,
duration, music), and an encoder credit (`©too`) pointing at
[kody.video](https://kody.video). Kody Video Plus users can opt into
**location tagging** on the record screen; clips then store device coordinates
in IndexedDB alongside the clip, never inside the MediaRecorder blob. Exports
omit those coordinates — and filming dates — by default, so a public share
does not disclose where or when it was made. A separate Plus-only export
toggle adds calendar dates and coordinates to chapter titles, a `©xyz` geotag
at the median of the majority cluster of clip locations (within 5 km), falling
back to the last located clip, and a capture timestamp (`©day` plus
`mvhd`/`tkhd` creation_time) from the last timeline video that has one — so a
Photos library can place the film on the right day and map pin. Share and Save
also stamp `File.lastModified` from that same last-clip time (Web Share copies
it onto the filesystem created/modified dates). Synology Photos sorts by those
file dates rather than the MP4 atoms. WebM exports skip this injection (the
WebM subset of Matroska excludes chapters). Clips recorded before this feature
simply lack the data and degrade gracefully.

### Export pipeline

`lib/export/` stitches clips into one file with two engines:

1. **Mediabunny + WebCodecs (preferred, all Chromium + recent Firefox/Safari):** each clip's own samples are demuxed and decoded directly by [Mediabunny](https://mediabunny.dev) (no playback pacing — the frame supply runs at hardware speed, keeps working in background tabs, and honors file rotation metadata), composited onto one canvas with the watermark, and encoded/muxed by Mediabunny, which owns the codec-config/packet-ordering/container details. Audio is decoded per clip and appended **sample-accurately**, so audio can never drift across clips; backpressure comes from awaiting the encoder. Container/codec negotiation strongly prefers **MP4 (H.264/HEVC + AAC)** — the most shareable output everywhere — and only falls back to **WebM (VP9/VP8 + Opus)** on non-iOS platforms without MP4 encoders. Clips WebCodecs can't decode take a realtime element-pump fallback per clip.
2. **Realtime fallback:** the old `canvas.captureStream` + `MediaRecorder` stitcher, hardened with timeouts and degenerate-segment skipping, for browsers without WebCodecs.

`plan.ts` is a pure, unit-tested planner that clamps trims and drops unplayable segments up front. The share flow completes the export **first**, then Share/Save run on fresh taps so the Web Share API always has the user activation it requires.

### Recording quality

- Phones prefer **hardware H.264** (`video/mp4`/`h264` MediaRecorder types) over software VP9 — software encoding is what makes previews and clips drop frames on Android.
- Capture stays at **30fps** (no dropped-frame shortcuts). About → **Video quality** picks the size/bitrate for *new* clips. Without Plus the default is **Standard** (720p). **High** (1080p, about 10 Mbps) is a Plus perk; **Saver** is 720p at a smaller bitrate. Already-saved clips are left alone. Bitrate still scales with the actual track size.
- A live MediaRecorder is armed on the record screen so the hardware encoder is already past its ~170ms startup hole when the user presses; the take adopts that session and trims the pre-roll.
- During a take the live viewfinder stays on screen; the extra thumb-mirror `<video>` is attached only at lift so the hold has two video sinks (overlay + encoder clone), not three. Record clones get `contentHint: motion`, and the encoder is not sliced every 250ms.
- Clip duration is measured from the encoded media after stop (wall-clock time includes encoder startup latency and corrupts trim/export math).
- The elapsed timer is a leaf component mutating its text node directly from a 10Hz boundary-aligned timer (a per-frame rAF loop would force 60 main-thread frames/s), so the ticking readout never re-renders the page during capture.
- Chromium's MediaRecorder drops recorded frames once the main thread stalls for ~200ms, so optional post-take work (clip hydration: container parses, audio-peak decode) waits while a take is recording (`lib/capture-activity.ts`). Saving the previous take never waits.
- Drag-to-zoom camera writes are coalesced: one `applyConstraints` in flight, at most one per camera frame, latest value wins (`lib/zoom-writer.ts`).
- Every take writes an on-device **recording-health report**: the saved file's real frame cadence (read from its timestamps, never its pixels), plus main-thread stalls, zoom, backgrounding, and encoder/save timings from the take. About → **Recording health** summarizes them and can share, copy, or (on kody.video) send the counters-only JSON. See [`docs/recording-smoothness.md`](docs/recording-smoothness.md) for findings and how to read a report.
- A screen wake lock is held while recording.
- Exports keep 1080p (long edge 1920), hold the last frame across source gaps so timestamp holes become a freeze instead of a hitch, and only drop frames closer than half a 30fps tick (jittery 30fps stays; 60fps extras go).

### Remix data flow (explicit updates, no hooks)

- **Components** are Remix 3 setup + render functions: state lives in plain
  setup-scope variables, re-renders happen only on explicit `handle.update()`.
- **Pages own their data**: each page loads IndexedDB state in setup and
  exposes `refresh()`; mutations write storage then call `refresh()`.
- **Camera** attaches via the **`ref()` mixin** (start on insert, stop when
  the element's abort signal fires).
- **Blob URLs** bind/revoke in `ref()` mixins (`BlobVideo`, `BlobImage`,
  `TimelineThumbImage`), re-synced from render when the blob changes.
- **Sheets** reset with `key={id}`; modality comes from `lib/sheet-modal.ts`.
- **Timers / toasts** use `requestAnimationFrame` / `setTimeout` started from event handlers.

### Storage (refresh-safe + personal)

| Store    | Contents                                              |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| projects | JSON metadata + ordered `clipIds`                     |
| clips    | Clip metadata, `Blob` media, filmstrip thumbnails     |
| undo     | Last deleted clip per project (for Undo)              |
| meta     | Settings (`maxProjects`, last opened id, onboarding)  |
| audio    | Background-music playlist per project (blobs, per-track trims/volumes/fades) |

Database name: `kody-video`. Blobs never leave the device unless the user explicitly shares/downloads.

### Offline / PWA

`vite-plugin-pwa` generates a service worker that precaches the app shell (`html/js/css/icons`). After the first successful visit:

1. Airplane mode still loads the SPA from Cache Storage (and from HTTP cache of the last-known HTML — installed PWAs must not wait on the network to paint).
2. Project/clip data continues to come from IndexedDB.
3. A newer deploy never replaces the open UI with a blank/loading screen; the existing "Update available" toast (or About → check) applies it on demand.

Installed / standalone launches (iOS especially) keep the last-known shell on screen from the first paint. The default iOS splash is white; the document itself must paint the app chrome immediately so that splash cannot stick. Recovery paths that drop the service worker are skipped while offline — wiping the only cached copy is the white screen of death.

Verified approach: `npm run build && node scripts/probe-pwa-offline.mjs` (load once online, then block the network and reload, including a simulated standalone display-mode). Or `npm run preview`, load once, then DevTools → Network → Offline (or OS airplane mode) and reload.

## Browser limits

- **iOS Safari:** WebCodecs audio support is incomplete; the realtime fallback engine covers it, but Chromium (especially Android) is the primary target.
- **iOS microphone:** WebKit can deliver muted audio tracks when mic and camera come from separate `getUserMedia` calls, so on iOS the mic is acquired together with the camera and held while the preview is open (everywhere else the mic is grabbed per-take). A live level monitor warns "Mic isn't picking up sound" during silent takes on every platform.
- **External mics on iOS (DJI transmitters, AirPods, wired headsets):** iOS pins web capture to the built-in mic by
  default. After the camera opens, the app kicks WebKit's `navigator.audioSession` into
  `play-and-record` — the documented nudge that re-routes capture to a connected external mic —
  and restores the session when the camera closes. Best-effort: routing remains OS-controlled.
- **Permissions:** denied camera/mic must be re-enabled in site settings; the UI surfaces this.
- **Storage quotas:** large projects can hit IndexedDB quotas; the soft 6-project cap helps.
- **Background tabs:** recording should stay in the foreground; browsers may throttle capture.
- **Ultra-wide (0.5×):** Android usually exposes the ultra-wide/telephoto as *separate* rear
  cameras, not as zoom below 1× — the lens chip next to the zoom chips switches between them.
  Some devices don't expose the extra lenses to browsers at all; the chip is hidden there.
  Phones that expose Android's *logical multi-camera* to the browser (zoom range below 1×,
  common on Samsung) get native-style seamless lens hand-off through the zoom gesture instead —
  the app detects such a lens the first time it's opened (cycle the chip once) and locks onto
  it for future sessions. Switching lenses with the chip afterward replaces that memory (your
  explicit choice always wins); opening the seamless lens again re-locks it. iPhones always
  work this way via the OS multi-lens camera.

## Desktop keyboard support

Kody Video is designed as a mobile camera app, but desktop gets first-class
keyboard support (hints appear automatically on fine-pointer devices):

- **Camera:** hold `Space` to record (release to stop), `F` flip, `T`
  self-timer, `S` screen recording, `E` editor, `P` play preview, `Delete`
  remove last clip.
- **Editor:** `←`/`→` select clip, `Alt`+arrows reorder, `T` trim, `D`
  duplicate, `Delete` delete, `P` play, `Esc` back to camera (or exit trim).
- **Playback:** `←`/`→` skip clips, `Space` pause/resume, `Esc` close.

## Screen recording (desktop)

The monitor button on the camera view (or `S`) records a screen, window, or
tab as a regular clip — pick the surface, narrate over your mic (mixed with
shared tab/system audio when you opt in), then tap the preview or the button
to stop and the take lands on the filmstrip like any camera clip. Desktop
browsers only: `getDisplayMedia` does not exist on iOS or Android, so on
phones use the OS screen recorder instead. The button hides itself where the
API is missing.

## Kody Video Plus purchase

The free plan includes one project, and exports carry a small Kody Video mark
in the corner. Kody Video Plus — a one-time $0.99 Stripe Payment Link —
removes the watermark, unlocks six project slots, 1080p High quality,
background music, landscape projects, and sending a project to another
device: the export
sheet (or a locked home slot, the locked "Add music" button in the editor,
or rotating an empty project sideways on the free plan) links to checkout,
Stripe redirects back to `/unlocked?session_id=…`, and a single Cloudflare
Pages Function (`functions/api/verify-purchase.ts`) verifies the session
server-side before the entitlement is stored in IndexedDB. 100%-off
promotion codes (friends / the developer) flow through the exact same
verification. Restore on another device: on the phone or computer that
already has Plus, open About and tap "Use Plus on another
device" — type the short code or scan the QR. "Already paid?"
on the export sheet still accepts that code (or a checkout
session id).

Projects are also created lazily — "New project" opens the camera at
`/project/new` and nothing is persisted until the first clip is recorded, so
backing out of an untouched project leaves no empty slot behind. The same
holds after creation: a project exited while still in its default state (no
clips, default name, no music) is silently deleted when the home screen
loads, since keeping it would change nothing the user can see.

Deployment requirements on the Cloudflare Pages project:

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (a restricted key with Checkout Sessions read access
  is enough)
- KV namespace binding `SYNC_ROOMS` for Plus send-to-device matchmaking
  (room codes + WebRTC descriptions only; never media). Without it, Send
  shows a configuration error and Save backup still works.

## Rewrite showcases

The app has been implemented four times as an experiment series, and every
edition stays online as a living showcase. Each deployment carries a
dismissible banner pointing back to the real app and to the PR where the
agent analyzed that edition:

| Origin | Edition | Analysis |
|--------|---------|----------|
| [kody.video](https://kody.video) | Remix 3 (this branch — production) | — |
| [remix.kody.video](https://remix.kody.video) | Remix 3 rewrite preview (proxies production) | [PR #87](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kody-video/pull/87) |
| [react.kody.video](https://react.kody.video) | React 19 + React Router 7 (pre-rewrite, branch `cursor/react-legacy-b52b`) | [PR #87](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kody-video/pull/87) |
| [vanilla.kody.video](https://vanilla.kody.video) | Web components, no build, no deps (branch `vanilla`) | [PR #88](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kody-video/pull/88) |
| [typescript.kody.video](https://typescript.kody.video) | The vanilla app in strict TypeScript, `tsc`-only build (branch `typescript`) | [PR #89](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kody-video/pull/89) |

Storage is per-origin, so projects recorded on a showcase stay there — use
backup/import to move them to [kody.video](https://kody.video).

## Support

Email [team@kody.video](mailto:team@kody.video) or open a GitHub issue (the
in-app About page has a link that pre-fills device details).

If the app opens to just the Kody hero with no project slots (a stale or
poisoned cached shell), two always-fresh pages ship with the app — served
under `/api/` so no service worker or cached shell can interfere:

- [kody.video/api/diag](https://kody.video/api/diag) — on-device, read-only
  diagnostics: confirms your projects/clips are present in IndexedDB, checks
  the cached vs network shell, and probes whether the app can mount.
- [kody.video/api/recover](https://kody.video/api/recover) — one-tap repair:
  drops the service worker and cached app files and re-primes them fresh.
  Never touches IndexedDB, so projects and clips are safe.

## Privacy

- No accounts, no cookies, no cross-site tracking.
- Page views are counted with [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com)
  (cookieless, anonymous, aggregate-only), loaded only on production
  hostnames.
- No clip upload endpoints exist in this app.
- Share/export uses user-gesture download or the Web Share API only.
- Network calls besides Stripe checkout (opened in the browser): the
  purchase-verification function above (never sees media); anonymous
  Sentry crash reports (error + stack trace only — breadcrumbs and request
  metadata are stripped in the SDK config; no PII, no media; only from
  production hostnames — dev and tests never report); and, only when you
  tap Send to device, a short-lived `/api/sync` matchmaking room (code +
  WebRTC descriptions, never clips). Export and import failures the UI
  surfaces as friendly messages are also captured, tagged with the failing
  step, so real-device bugs surface.
- The home-screen tour video (shown to first-time users) streams from
  `media.kody.video` (an R2 bucket behind the app's own zone — no third-party
  player, no tracking) and only when the user taps play on it.

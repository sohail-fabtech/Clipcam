# Running & testing

The canonical command list lives in `README.md` and `package.json`. Notes below
cover the non-obvious bits.

## Dev server

`npm run dev` starts Vite on port `5173`. The Playwright e2e suite starts its
own dev server on port `4189`, so `npm run test:e2e` can run alongside a
`npm run dev` session.

## Lint / unit tests

- Lint & typecheck: `npm run lint` (`tsc -b`).
- Unit tests: `npm test` (Vitest browser mode — tests run in headless
  Chromium against real browser APIs: IndexedDB, localStorage, AudioContext).

Vitest browser-mode notes:

- The suite needs Playwright's Chromium installed (same install as e2e, see
  below).
- Test-side code runs in the browser, so Node APIs are unavailable in test
  files. Anything that genuinely needs Node (e.g. running ffmpeg for the MP4
  metadata test) lives in a [custom command](https://vitest.dev/api/browser/commands)
  (`src/test/ffmpeg-command.ts`) that executes on the Vitest server.
- `vi.resetModules()` does not invalidate the browser module graph. Modules
  with test-relevant module-level state export explicit reset helpers instead
  (`resetRecordingMimeTypeForTests`, `resetMicMonitorForTests`,
  `resetAppUpdateForTests`, `__resetDbForTests`).

## End-to-end / smoke tests

`npm test` (browser mode), `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright), and
`npm run test:smoke` need Playwright's Chromium browser installed:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

The e2e suite runs with a fake camera/mic, so it does not need real hardware.
Specs that capture screenshots write them under `test-results/` (Playwright's
per-test output dir). Set `E2E_SHOTS_DIR` to also copy them elsewhere, e.g.
`E2E_SHOTS_DIR=/opt/cursor/artifacts npm run test:e2e` on Cursor Cloud VMs.
See [manual-camera-testing.md](./manual-camera-testing.md) for driving the
camera/record/export flow manually in a headless environment.

Installed-PWA offline first paint (production service worker) is covered by
`npm run build && node scripts/probe-pwa-offline.mjs`. That is the automated
stand-in for "airplane mode, reopen the home-screen app": it asserts the
cached shell paints and the document is never blank white. Real iOS/Android
standalone remains on [manual-test-checklist.md](../../manual-test-checklist.md).

## Capture smoothness probe

`node scripts/probe-capture-cadence.mjs` records real hold-to-record takes
with a fake 30fps camera and reports each saved clip's frame cadence (fps,
missing frames, worst gap) against main-thread long tasks and lag during
the hold, plus the app's own take report. Scenarios, flags, and how to
read the results are in
[`docs/recording-smoothness.md`](../recording-smoothness.md#reproducing-locally).

## CLA checker

`node tools/ci/check-cla.mjs --self-test` verifies the inbound CLA allowlist and signer rules.
